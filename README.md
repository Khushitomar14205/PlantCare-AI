# 🌿 PlantCare AI: Advanced Plant Disease Detection Using Transfer Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
The AI-Based Plant Disease Detection System is a deep learning project that detects diseases from images using Transfer Learning. The system takes an image as input, processes it, and predicts the disease category using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

This project aims to help users detect diseases quickly and accurately using artificial intelligence.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Manual disease detection can be time-consuming and inaccurate. Early detection is important to prevent serious damage. This system uses AI to automate disease detection from images.

---

## 🚀 Objective 
- Build an image classification model using Transfer Learning.
- Detect disease categories from uploaded images.
- Deploy the model through a simple web interface.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Flask (for web app)
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🧠 Model Approach
We are using **Transfer Learning** with a pre-trained CNN model (e.g., MobileNet / ResNet) to improve accuracy and reduce training time.

Workflow:
1. Image Input
2. Image Preprocessing
3. Feature Extraction (Pre-trained CNN)
4. Classification Layer
5. Disease Prediction Output
